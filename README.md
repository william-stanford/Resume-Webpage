# Resume-Webpage

This project grew out of a need for a code sample for a job application. I spent a few hours putting these two pages together. 
One is the actual HTML page and the other is its CSS style page. I have to admit that my creativity does not run towards visual 
design. Everything works as it should, it just looks like it was made in 2002.
